        How to choose the right IDE for your code style?
    </h1>

    <p>
        Everyone has a preference for a different IDE when coding, some prefer a system that has constant updates, support, plugins. Others would use a specific one just because that is the one they have learned on. It does not really matter what you choose, all of them are capable to do the same job.<br>
         <br>
        Finding the right IDE for you style of code you help you get work flow, consistence and make your life hundred times easier.<br>
        My choice was PHPStorm from Jetbrains, the main reason why I choose it, is because they have free license for students. Let`s talk a little bit about its features:<br>
